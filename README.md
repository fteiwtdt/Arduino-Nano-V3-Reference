### Arduino-Nano-V3-Reference

These Eagle project files were downloaded from [arduino.cc](https://arduino.cc) and had been modified. The original ```.sch``` file is incompatible with newer version of Eagle. Text replacement is needed for upward compatible.

- Download this [zip](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Nano-reference.zip) and unzip.
- Open Eagle, then "Open"->"Text..." to select NanoV3.3.sch file from the unzipped folder.
- Saving after "find-and-replace".
